## Overview
***
In this project, I explore a dataset that stores the closing prices of the Magnificent 7 stocks (AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, META, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA) from November 2014 to November 2024. My goal was to find the best performers out of the seven stocks, based solely on price action. I measured and compared price action YTD (year-to-date), as well as in the last decade. Some factors I took into consideration were overall price increase and timespan. 

The biggest learning experience of this project was navigating datetime datatypes and implementing the different libraries, methods, and built-in functions associated with them. With the slight assistance of AI tools like ChatGPT, I was able to deepen my understanding of how Python can be used to manipulate datetime objects. I believe this project sufficiently demonstrates my current skills in Python with data manipulation, preparation, and cleaning.

The Python libraries I use are:

* pandas
* matplotlib.pyplot
* matplotlib.dates
